                Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook until soft and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

                Heat tortillas in a skillet or directly on the grates of a gas stove until soft and pliable. Place 3 tablespoons of chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Fold over and roll into taquitos.

                Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place taquitos in a single layer in the air fryer basket, making sure they are not touching, and mist with avocado oil.

                Cook until golden brown, 6 to 9 minutes. Turn taquitos over, mist with avocado oil, and air fry until crispy, 3 to 5 minutes.             </li>
