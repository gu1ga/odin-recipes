        <h3>Dleicious potates made with an air fryer.</h3>

        <p>These air fryer baby potatoes are very similar to roasted potatoes. They're crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound baby potatoes, cut into quarters</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon avocado oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried parsley</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather all ingredients. Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            </li>
            <li>
                Place potatoes into a bowl; add oil and toss to coat. Add garlic, parsley, and salt; toss until well distributed. Transfer potatoes to the air fryer basket. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the basket into the preheated air fryer and cook, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
